<pre>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to
create web pages. It is the backbone of a website, providing the structure
and content that the web browser renders to the user.HTML was first proposed
by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989, while working at CERN. The first publicly available 
description of HTML was a document called "HTML Tags," which was written by Berners-Lee in 1991.</pre>
