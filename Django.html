<h1><strong>Django</strong></h1>    
<pre>Django is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.
It follows the model-template-views (MTV) architectural pattern and provides a robust set of features for building web applications.
Django includes an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) system for database interactions, a powerful admin interface for managing application
data, and built-in support for user authentication, URL routing, and form handling.
