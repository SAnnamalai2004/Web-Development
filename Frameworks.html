<h1><strong>Frameworks</strong></h1>    
<pre>Frameworks are pre-built software structures that provide a foundation for developing applications.
They offer reusable components, libraries, and tools that streamline the development process, allowing 
developers to focus on building features rather than starting from scratch. Frameworks can be specific
to programming languages or platforms and often follow design patterns to promote best practices in software development.</pre>
