<pre>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a language used to describe the style and appearance
of web pages. It works alongside HTML to control how content is displayed. With CSS, 
developers can set colors, fonts, spacing, layouts, and even create animations or 
responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes. By separating content (HTML) 
from design (CSS), websites become easier to maintain and visually consistent across 
different pages and devices. CSS plays a vital role in making the web both functional 
and beautiful.</pre>
