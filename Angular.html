<h1><strong>Angular</strong></h1>
<pre>Angular is a platform and framework for building single-page client applications using HTML and TypeScript.
It is developed and maintained by Google and provides a comprehensive set of tools and libraries for building 
dynamic web applications. Angular follows the component-based architecture, allowing developers to create reusable 
UI components, manage application state, and handle routing efficiently. It also includes features like dependency 
injection, two-way data binding, and a powerful templating system, making it a popular choice for building modern web applications.</pre>
