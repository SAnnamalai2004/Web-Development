<h1><strong>Node.js</strong></h1>   
<pre>Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to run JavaScript code on the server side.
It was created by Ryan Dahl in 2009 and has since gained immense popularity for building scalable and high-performance web applications. Node.js
uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, making it efficient for handling concurrent requests.</pre>
